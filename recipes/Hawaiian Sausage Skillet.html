    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these
      ingredients. So I kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can be
      adjusted for sweetness, and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than desired I
      suggest adding a little chicken broth as it's thickening. Serve
      immediately over rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Â¾ fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into chunks</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage,
        onion, and green bell pepper until vegetables start to become tender,
        about 8 minutes; add pineapple and cook, stirring occasionally, until
        the pineapple is hot, about 5 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl using a whisk.
        Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and minced garlic with the
        pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves into the liquid; pour over the
        sausage mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes.
